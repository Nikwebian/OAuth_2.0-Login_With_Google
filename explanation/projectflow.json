ðŸ“Œ Full Practical OAuth 2.0 Flow in Your App

User visits http://localhost:3000/auth/google.

Passport redirects user to Googleâ€™s Authorization Server.

User logs into Google & approves permissions.

Google sends back Authorization Code to /auth/google/callback.

Passport exchanges code â†’ gets Access Token + Profile Info.

Passport stores/fetches user in MongoDB.

Passport serializes user â†’ puts user ID into session cookie.


On next requests, session cookie is checked â†’ user automatically loaded (deserializeUser).

User can now access protected routes (/auth/profile).

If they log out â†’ session destroyed â†’ must login again.




âš¡ So in short:

index.js = Setup & middleware

db.js = Connect DB

userSchema.js = Store users

passport.js = OAuth setup (Google Strategy)

authRoutes.js = Rout
